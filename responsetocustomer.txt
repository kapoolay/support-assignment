Hi Bob,

Thank you for reaching out to Streamlit Support! I appreciate you providing the links and information needed for us to troubleshoot on our end.

Your program to prompt the user for parameters is perfect and from there we were able to produce a working program for you.

Steps:
1. We assign the user's input that we received from the selection prompt to a variable (site_url). Please note the user's choice was stored in the variable "status_code".
--
site_url = f"https://http.cat/{status_code}"
--

2. We then use "st.image" to render the requested image using the value we stored in site_url.
--
st.image(site_url, caption='Cat')
--

You can find the documentation on the "st.image" method here: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/media/st.image

Attached is the full program. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or issues.

Best Regards,

Kevin Capule
